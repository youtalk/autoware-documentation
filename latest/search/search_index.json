Any researchers, students, individuals or organizations are welcome to participate and submit their solution to any of the challenges we propose. Ongoing Japan Automotive AI Challenge 2023 Registration: June 5, 2023 - July 14, 2023 Qualifiers: July 3, 2023 - Aug. 31, 2023 Finals: Nov. 12, 2023 In this competition, we focus on challenging tasks posed by autonomous driving in factory environments and aim to develop Autoware-based AD software that can overcome them. The qualifiers use the digital twin autonomous driving simulator AWSIM to complete specific tasks within a virtual environment. Teams that make it to the finals have the opportunity to run their software on actual vehicles in a test course in Japan."},{"location":"autoware-competitions/#proposing-new-competition","title":"Proposing New Competition","text":"<p>If you want add a new competition to this page, please propose it in a TSC meeting and get confirmation from the AWF.</p>"},{"location":"contributing/","title":"Contributing","text":""},{"location":"contributing/#contributing","title":"Contributing","text":"<p>Thank you for your interest in contributing!

Autonomous driving systems based on the microautonomy architecture, therefore, must be designed to be fail-safe but not never-fail. We accept that the timing constraints may be violated (the given deadlines may be missed) as far as the overrun is taken into account. The overrun handlers are two-fold: (i) platform-defined and (ii) user-defined. The platform-defined handler is implemented as part of the platform by default, while the user-defined handler can overwrite it or add a new handler to the system.

For supported LiDAR models, please check the GitHub repository of each algorithm. While these ROS 2-based SLAM implementations can be easily installed and used directly on the same machine that runs Autoware, it is important to note that they may not be as well-tested or as mature as ROS 1-based alternatives.</p> <p>The notable open-source SLAM implementations that are based on ROS 1 include hdl-graph-slam (LiDAR, IMU*, GNSS*), LeGO-LOAM (LiDAR, IMU*), LeGO-LOAM-BOR (LiDAR), and LIO-SAM (LiDAR, IMU, GNSS).</p> <p>Most of these algorithms already have a built-in loop-closure and pose graph optimization. However, if the built-in, automatic loop-closure fails or does not work correctly, you can use Interactive SLAM to adjust and optimize a pose graph manually.</p>"},{"location":"how-to-guides/integrating-autoware/creating-maps/open-source-slam/#list-of-third-party-slam-implementations","title":"List of Third Party SLAM Implementations","text":"Package Name Explanation Repository Link Loop Closure Sensors ROS Version Dependencies FAST-LIO-LC A computationally efficient and robust LiDAR-inertial odometry package with loop closure module and graph optimization https://github.com/yanliang-wang/FAST_LIO_LC &amp;check; LidarIMUGPS [Optional] ROS 1 ROS MelodicPCL &gt;= 1.8Eigen &gt;= 3.3.4GTSAM &gt;= 4.0.0 FAST_LIO_SLAM FAST_LIO_SLAM is the integration of FAST_LIO and SC-PGO which is scan context based loop detection and GTSAM based pose-graph optimization https://github.com/gisbi-kim/FAST_LIO_SLAM &amp;check; LidarIMUGPS [Optional] ROS 1 PCL &gt;= 1.8Eigen &gt;= 3.3.4 FD-SLAM FD_SLAM is Feature&amp;Distribution-based 3D LiDAR SLAM method based on Surface Representation Refinement.

The variety of configurations makes it difficult to define the uniform metrics for evaluating Autoware. However, the policies used to define them are basically reused even when the configuration changes. Each of temporal performance metrics is categorized into two types: execution frequency and response time. Although there are many types of metrics, such as communication latency, the only two types are considered for simplicity. Execution frequency is observed using rate of Inter-Process Communication (IPC) messages. You will find an enormous number of messages in Autoware, but you don't have to take care of all. Some messages might be critical to functionality and they should be chosen for evaluation. Response time is duration elapsed through a series of processing. A series of processing is referred to as a path. Response time is calculated from timestamps of start and end of a path. Although many paths can be defined in Autoware, you have to choose significant paths.</p> <p>As a hint, here are some characteristics of message and path in order to choose metrics.</p> <ol> <li>Messages and paths on boundaries where observed values from sensors are consumed</li> <li>Messages and paths on boundaries of functions, e.g., a boundary of perception and planning</li> <li>Messages and paths on boundaries where timer-based frequency is switched</li> <li>Messages and paths on boundaries where two different messages are synchronized and merged</li> <li>Messages that must be transmitted at expected frequency, e.g., vehicle command messages</li> </ol> <p>Those hints would be helpful for most configurations but there may be exclusions.

Such mapping is usually calibrated automatically using the <code>accel_brake_map_calibrator</code> module, but it may produce a low initial throttle which leads to high start delays.</p> <p>In order to increase the initial throttle, there are two options: increase the initial acceleration output by Autoware, or modify the acceleration to throttle mapping.</p> <p>The initial acceleration output by Autoware can be tuned in the <code>motion_velocity_smoother</code> with parameters <code>engage_velocity</code> and <code>engage_acceleration</code>.

If we look at an example acceleration map, it does the following conversion: when the ego velocity is <code>0</code> (first column), acceleration values between <code>0.631</code> (first row) and <code>0.836</code> (second row) are converted to a throttle between <code>0%</code> and <code>10%</code>.
